**Theme**: 
As part of learning creating projects is a must in technology not only it helps you get handson practice but also creates a portfolio so the same goes with me and is the main purpose of creating this dashboard horning my technical skills and using my manegerial skills to bring out insightful analysis.

**Project Description**

FedEx Logistics manages a complex global supply chain, dealing with shipments across various regions, countries, and industries. This dataset provides an in-depth look at their logistics processes, capturing important information on purchase orders (POs), shipment methods, vendor agreements (INCO terms), delivery schedules, and product-specific details such as item descriptions and dosage forms. Effective management of these processes ensures timely delivery, minimizes freight costs, and improves customer satisfaction.

Given the rise of eCommerce and global distribution, companies like FedEx must continuously optimize their logistics operations to maintain a competitive edge. The dataset is designed to provide insights into how shipments are managed, identify bottlenecks or delays, and ensure cost-effectiveness. By analyzing the data, FedEx Logistics aims to streamline supply chain operations, improving delivery timelines and reducing costs for both the company and its customers.
